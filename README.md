US Accidents Exploratory Data Analysis
Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

This project aims to analyze the provided dataset to discover insights that can be visually expressed through the data. The specific objectives include:

* Clean and organize the data to ensure consistency and integrity of information.
* Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, trends, and potential anomalies.
* Validate correlations between the number of accidents and weather conditions through statistical analysis and visualization techniques.
* Graphically represent findings creatively and effectively to clearly communicate conclusions derived from data analysis.
